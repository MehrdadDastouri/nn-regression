# Neural Network for Regression
This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a simple neural network designed to perform regression on synthetic data. The project demonstrates how neural networks can generalize linear regression and handle more complex relationships in data.

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

In this project, you will find:
- A synthetic dataset generated with a linear relationship and added noise.
- A neural network with one hidden layer (10 neurons) and ReLU activation.
- The model is trained to predict continuous target values using Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.

This project is part of a daily learning initiative to explore machine learning and deep learning concepts using PyTorch.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- **Input Layer**: 1 input feature (e.g., `X` values from the dataset).
- **Hidden Layer**: 10 neurons with ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron to predict continuous target values.
- **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.01.
